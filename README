Bash script to setup SSH Port Forwarding
Perfect for creating Bash/ZSH/*SH aliases around

Usage: ssh-port-forward <forward_name> <local_port> <forwarded_host> <forwarded_port>
                        <ssh_host>

ssh-port-forward options
    -b <forward_name>      Opens the specified forward in the default browser
    -h                      Prints this help message
    -k <forward_name>       Closes the forward by the specified name

ssh options
    -i <identity_file>      Specify ssh keyfile to use for authentication
    -p <ssh_port>           Specify a port that the ssh server is running on

Browser options
    -s                      Specify whether to use SSL/TLS when opening in the browser
    -t                      Silent Mode: Does not open the link in the browser

When run, creates a $FORWARD_NAME-ssh.run file in /var/run/user/$UID/ssh-port-forward/ which contains the PID of ssh, the local port, remote host, and remote port.

If /var/run/user/$UID/ does not exist, script will exit 1


Features to add:
	- Saving of PID to allow easy exiting (with a --exit or --kill flag) [x] Added
	- Add configurable temp directory
